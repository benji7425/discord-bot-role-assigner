# Changelog
## v4.0.0
Version 4.0 is a complete re-write of the bot using TypeScript and built on top of my [disharmony library](https://github.com/benji7425/disharmony).
This changelog entry does not assume knowledge of v3.5 or prior, and so list additions as if this is a new project.

### Added

- Command *set-joinable* to configure (or unconfigure) a role as joinable
- Commands *join* and *leave* to join/leave a configured role
- Command *configure-invite* to configure an invite to assign a role on server join
- Commands *view-roles* and *view-invites* to view configured roles/invites
